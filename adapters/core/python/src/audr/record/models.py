"""The public AUDR record model.

The shape of a record comes from the specification, so it is generated into
:mod:`audr.record._schema` and never written by hand. What lives here is the behaviour the
SDK owns on top of that shape: the identifiers and timestamps an emitter should not have to
supply, the parse/serialize boundary, and the prose rules a JSON Schema cannot state.

Three generated classes are subclassed. ``Timing`` gains a default ``event_time`` so a caller
can time an operation by building the record at the end of it. ``Attribution`` gains its
billability rules. ``AUDR`` gains SDK-owned defaults, and re-declares ``timing``
and ``attribution`` with the subclass types so parsing builds the richer classes. Every other
block is re-exported exactly as generated.
