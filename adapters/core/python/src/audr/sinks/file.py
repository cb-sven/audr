    """Write records as newline-delimited JSON to a path or an open text stream.

    A path target is opened lazily on the first `deliver()` call (mode `"a"` if
    `append` else `"w"`, `encoding="utf-8"`) and closed by `close()`. A stream target
    (anything else, such as an already-open file object or `io.StringIO`) is written
    to as given and is never closed by this sink.

    Retry caveat: `deliver()` writes records one line at a time and flushes once per
    batch; if an `OSError` occurs part-way through a batch, lines already written stay
    in the file while the whole batch is reported `RETRYABLE_FAILURE`, so an
    application that replays failed records from the `on_failure` callback may write
    duplicate lines. Consumers of the file should de-duplicate on `record_id`. The
    pipeline itself never retries.
