# Merge Gateway

An [adapter](../README.md) that wraps Merge Gateway's native SDK client and turns every
response, streamed or not, and every embedding call into an [AUDR](../../spec/SPEC.md)
record for an `@openaudr/audr` `Client` the host application owns. Token counts and the
per-call cost come from Gateway's own usage report; attribution comes from `withAudr`
scopes with configurable defaults. The adapter reads no input, output, tools or tags.
