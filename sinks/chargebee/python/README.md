# audr-sink-chargebee

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/audr-sink-chargebee?include_prereleases)](https://pypi.org/project/audr-sink-chargebee/)

> **Status: alpha.** The record model tracks AUDR v1.0.0 and is stable; the Python API
> may change in minor releases before 1.0.

The Chargebee sink for [AUDR](https://openaudr.dev). Delivers `audr.AUDR` record
batches to a site's usage-ingest batch endpoint.

```bash
pip install audr-sink-chargebee
```

```python
import asyncio
import audr
from audr_sink_chargebee import ChargebeeSink

# A full record; construction is documented in the core SDK README:
# https://github.com/openaudr/audr/blob/main/adapters/core/python/README.md
# Chargebee additionally requires attribution.subscription_id.
record = audr.AUDR(...)


async def main() -> None:
    sink = ChargebeeSink(site="acme", api_key="cb_live_...")
    async with audr.Client(
        sink,
        emitter=audr.Emitter(component="harness", name="my-harness", version="1.4.0"),
    ) as client:
        result = client.record(record)
        assert result.queued, result.issues


asyncio.run(main())
```

Every record requires an emitter. Pass `emitter=` to the `Client` as above and it is
stamped onto any record that arrives without one; a record that reaches validation
with no emitter is rejected with a `/emitter` issue and never sent.

Configure the sink with `site` and `api_key`. Pass them explicitly or set `CHARGEBEE_SITE`
and `CHARGEBEE_API_KEY`; explicit values take precedence, and `api_key` is always required.
Credentials belong to the sink and never appear in logs, errors, or `repr()`.

The sink sends each batch to `https://{site}.{ingest_domain}/api/v2/batch/usage_events`.

- `ingest_domain` defaults to `ingest.chargebee.com`, the Chargebee batch ingest domain.
- Override the domain with `ingest_domain=` or `CHARGEBEE_INGEST_DOMAIN`, for example to
  target a test environment.
- For a host that is not a `{site}` subdomain of the ingest domain, set the full origin
  with `ingest_url=` or `CHARGEBEE_INGEST_URL`. This is mutually exclusive with `site` and
  `ingest_domain`.

## Routing and delivery

- Chargebee routes on `attribution.subscription_id`. A record with no
  `subscription_id` is never sent; `deliver()` returns it as a
  `RejectedRecord(record_id, "missing_subscription_id")`.
- `record_id` is used as Chargebee's `deduplication_id` and
  `timing.event_time` (as milliseconds) becomes `usage_timestamp`.
- AUDR records are nested; Chargebee's ingest API accepts scalar properties
  only, so the sink flattens every field to reversible names such as
  `usage_llm_input_tokens`. The default separator is `_`; it is
  configurable via `separator=` and must be one or more underscores, since
  Chargebee property names may only contain letters, digits, and
  underscores.
- A batch is sent as one request. If Chargebee refuses it as too large it
  answers `413` and `deliver()` fails the whole batch with
  `detail="payload_too_large"`, dropping every record in it; send fewer
  records per request with `Client(batch_max_size=...)`. That bounds the
  record count, not the byte size — a single record too large on its own
  cannot be delivered.
- When a `207` response body contains a failed event that cannot be matched
  back to a record in the batch (an unrecognized or duplicated
  `deduplication_id`), every non-rejected record in that batch is
  conservatively reported as `unknown` rather than assumed accepted; `record_id`
  makes a replay idempotent.
- `close()` is idempotent.

Each HTTP response becomes one `audr.BatchResult`:

| Response | Outcome | `detail` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `202`, `207` | `ACCEPTED`; `rejected` and `unknown` name individual records | |
| `401` | `PERMANENT_FAILURE` | `auth` |
| `413` | `PERMANENT_FAILURE` | `payload_too_large` |
| other `4xx` | `PERMANENT_FAILURE` | `http_<status>` |
| `429`, `5xx`, network error | `RETRYABLE_FAILURE`, once `RetryPolicy` is exhausted | |

## Data handling

This sink flattens and forwards **every field of the record**, including
`attribution.labels` and any `x_*` extension, to your Chargebee site. Delivery is
verbatim, and no downstream component re-checks the record. `attribution.labels`
MUST NOT contain PII and `resource.key_name` is a label, never key material — see
the [security policy](https://github.com/openaudr/audr/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for
the full rules. Enforce them where the record is built — that is the last point at
which they can be enforced.

## Retry, transport and flattening

Delivery behaviour is tuned on the constructor, alongside the `site` and `api_key`
described above:

```python
from audr_sink_chargebee import ChargebeeSink, HttpTransportConfig, RetryPolicy

sink = ChargebeeSink(
    site="acme",
    api_key="...",
    retry=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=3),
    http=HttpTransportConfig(read_timeout=10.0),
    separator="_",
)
```
